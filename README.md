# lOnlyGames
lOnlyGames is a social gaming collaboration platform, aimed at connecting users with similar gaming interests.
It is a platform that allows a user to find other players based on characteristics such as games played, type of gamer, skills in a particular game, location and availability.
Once a particular player is selected the user will then be matched with that player and can choose to connect allowing them to share their in-game contact details such as Steam, Discord ID, in-game username.
In conjunction secondary features include an achievements system, through Restful practices, OnlyGames will connect with external APIs, allowing the platform to display the in-game statistics of users.
These statistics will be included for most popular games. The system will also compromise an encrypted chatting feature, allowing users to communicate with matched players.
A user can only match with other players, if the action is also reciprocated.
